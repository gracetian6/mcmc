# MCMC for Sampling Colorings

## Setup

Install the `igraph` C library and build the project by running `make all`. Our `Makefile` is configured
for compilation on a Mac machine where `igraph` has been installed via `homebrew`; you may have to adjust
`IGRAPH_INCLUDE_DIR` and `IGRAPH_LIB_DIR` in the `Makefile`.

## Usage

The executable `sample_colorings` will be contained in the `bin` directory after compilation. Navigate there,
and run `insert the command here once ready`.
